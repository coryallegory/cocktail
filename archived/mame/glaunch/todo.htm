<h1 align=center>Game Launcher TODO List</h1>

<h2>High Priority</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Add theme support. </li>
<li>
[SOURCE] Clean up destructors to do something useful, like release
bitmaps.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Medium Priority</h2>

<p>
<ul>
<li> Add support for vertical monitors rotated right. </li>

<li>
When using a CD for background music under Windows, the default
Windows CD player automatically launches itself and takes over the CD.
This results in Game Launcher and the Windows CD player fighting for
control of the CD and the CD plays when it shouldn't.  I may just
disable CD player support if running under Windows.
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<h2>Low Priority</h2>


<p>
<ul>

<li>
Support real arcade monitors.  This doesn't look that likely, though.
The Allegro graphics library does not support these graphics modes.
Currently, I rely too heavily on the Allegro bitmap structure and
blit() functions to move away from Allegro.  Any hints or suggestions
(or code) to do this is welcome!
</li>

<li>
Add GUI to configure everything.  Not real likely.  I'm a Unix geek by
day, and I don't mind editing config files.  More likely a couple
dialog boxes will appear to configure certain things I think would be
good to configure without quitting.  For example, the current game's
options.  That way you can repeatedly tweak the options for a specific
game without quitting and starting up a text editor.
</li>

<li>[SOURCE] Get a clean compile with -pedantic.</li>
</ul>
