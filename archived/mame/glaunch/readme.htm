<h1 align=center>Game Launcher</h1>
<p align=center> <small> Version 0.9.8 - 14 May 2002 </small>
<br> <small> (C) 1999-2002, Dave Dribin </small> </p>

<h2>What Is It</h2>

<p> Game Launcher is a cross platform universal front end for
emulators.  The main goal is to provide a user interface that is easy
to use and attractive, yet does not look like a tradition user
interface with windows and such.  Game Launcher should work with any
emulator.  It has been known to work with MAME, Nesticle, RockNES,
zSNES, snes9x, Callus, Stella, z26, and Genecyst.  Game Launcher has
been ported to DOS, Windows, and Unix.
</p>

<h2>Who and Why</h2>

<p>
Game Launcher was written by Dave Dribin.  I wrote it because I wanted
something a little different than existing DOS front ends.  It is
intended for people using VGA monitors (including the <a
href="http://www.wellsgardner.com/">Wells-Gardner</a> U3100 SVGA
monitor) inside an arcade cabinet.  The latest version can always be
found at <a href="http://www.dribin.org/dave/game_launcher/">
http://www.dribin.org/dave/game_launcher/</a>.

</p>

<h2>Configuring Game Launcher</h2>

<p>
The <tt>glaunch.cfg</tt> file contains the global configuration
options.  It contains a list of emulators to support and what kind of
background music is desired.  All other configuration options are
emulator specific and are contained in the <tt>config/</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>
Each emulator listed in <tt>glaunch.cfg</tt> must have a corresponding
cfg file in the <tt>config/</tt> directory.  For example, if "mame" is
listed in <tt>glaunch.cfg</tt>, then <tt>config/mame.cfg</tt> contains
the configuration options for MAME.
</p>

<p>
I will beef up this section more later, but for now, please look at
<tt>config/template.cfg</tt> and the other examples I use provided in
the <tt>config/</tt> directory.  I've tried to make the config file
self-documenting. :)
</p>


<h3>Using mamescan.exe</h3>

<p>
<tt>mamescan.exe</tt> is a command line tool that automatically
creates a .map and .rom file for MAME by scanning the ROMs you have
installed.  It uses the MAME executable to figure out which ROMs are
buried inside merged ROMs.  By default, only the primary ROMs are
included and all clones are skipped.  Individual ROMs may be included
and excluded by using a constraint file.
</p>

<p>
A mamescan config file, by default <tt>mamescan.cfg</tt> specifies the
path the a MAME executable, the path to MAME ROMs, and the
configuration file to use for Game Launcher.  The configuration file
to use is really the base pathname of the configuration file to use.
Two configuration files are created by mamescan.  If the base path
name given is <tt>config/mame</tt>, then the files created are
<tt>config/mame.map</tt> and <tt>config/mame.rom</tt>.  This path may
be relative or absolute.
</p>

<p>
You can force the inclusion and exclusion of individual ROMs in the
configuration file if you want to override the default choices.  In
the constraint section of the config file, any line beginning with a
'+' forces inclusion and any line beginning with a '-' forces
exclusion.  For example, the <tt>pacman.zip</tt> file contains the
games <tt>pacman</tt> (the Namco version) and <tt>pacmanm</tt> (the
Midway version).  The "primary" ROM is <tt>pacman</tt> and the clone
is <tt>pacmanm</tt>, so mamescan will include <tt>pacman</tt> and
exclude <tt>pacmanm</tt>.  Say you do not want to include
<tt>pacman</tt>, but want to include <tt>pacmanm</tt>.  You can add
the following lines to the constraint section of the configuration
file:
</p>

<pre>
-pacman
+pacmanm
</pre>

<h3>Configuring Screen Resolution</h3>

<p>
Any resolution available by your DOS VESA driver should be available
to use.  If the chosen resolution is not available, Game Launcher will
not run.  Not all resolutions look that good, though, especially
depending on the menu orientation.  For horizontal orientation, I
would recommend either 800x600 or 400x300.  800x600 looks <b>much</b>
nicer because the anti-aliasing of the fonts is much less noticeable.
For vertical orientation, I would recommend either 640x480 or 320x240.
640x480 looks nicer again because of the anti-aliasing.
<p>

</p>
Also higher resolutions may result in slower animations.  This can be
caused by running out of VRAM or processing power.  The lack of VRAM
causes slower animation because Game Launcher will use VRAM if your
video card supports hardware acceleration.  If you're curious if VRAM
is being used, check the log file.  If your video driver does not
support hardware acceleration, then VRAM will not be used under any
circumstances.
</p>

<h3>Configuring Fonts</h3>

<p>
Any TrueType font is supported, although very thin and/or small fonts
may show some pink spots.  The font size is fully customizable by
choosing the point size.  An appropriate size is mostly personal
preference.  I prefer an 18 point font in horizontal orientation at a
resolution of 800x600 or vertical orientation at 640x480, but smaller
fonts look OK, too.  For smaller resolutions, I prefer a 10 point font
for horizontal orientation at 400x300 or vertical orientation at
320x240.  You really cannot go any smaller than 8 point without the
font looking terrible.  Any larger than 10 point results in only a few
menu items to fit on the screen.  10 points seems like a nice
compromise.
</p>

<h3>Configuring Screen Shots</h3>

<p>
The first configuration parameter of the screen shot is the delay to
wait before displaying the screen shot.  This helps speed up the
scrolling by not displaying every screen shot right away.  Of course
you can make this as low as you want (even zero) if you like.
</p>

<p>
The brightness of the screen shot is also configurable.  If the screen
shot is too bright, then the menu text is hard to read.  If the screen
shot is too dim, then it can barely be seen.  Tweak this parameter to
your tastes.
</p>

<p>
Finally, how the screen shot is scaled is also configurable.  The
screen shot is always scaled to the largest possible size, otherwise
it could be very tiny.  Since screen shots are rarely an exact
multiple of the screen resolution, the scaling factor of the screen
shot may be non-integer number.  When a screen shot is scaled by a
non-integer, it will get distorted.  Because I don't like the
distortion, there is an option to prefer integer scaling factors over
non-integer factors.  If the screen shot needs to be shrunk, then
non-integer scaling factors will be used since distortion is bound to
happen anyways.  If the distortion doesn't bother you, then turn of
integer scaling all the time.  You will get screen shots with a better
fit at the cost of distortion.  The choice is up to you.
</p>

<h3>Key Mappings</h3>

<p>
The following table summarizes the default key mapping:
</p>

<table>
<tr><td> UP, DOWN </td>
  <td> Move the game selection up/down one game. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td> RIGHT, LEFT </td>
  <td> Move the game selection up/down one screen, like page up and
page down. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td> 1 </td> <td> Play selected game. </td></tr>
<tr><td> LEFT CONTROL </td> <td> Go to next emulator. </td></tr>
<tr><td> LEFT ALT </td> <td> Go to previous emulator. </td></tr>
<tr><td> ESC </td> <td> Exit Game Launcher. </td></tr>
<tr><td> SPACE </td>
  <td> Displays the screen shot.  Press again to get back to menu. </td>
</tr>
<tr><td> G </td> <td> Skip to next MP3. </td></tr>
<tr><td> D </td> <td> Restart current MP3. </td></tr>
</table>

<p>
All key mappings are configurable in <tt>glaunch.cfg</tt>.
</p>


<h3>Launching Arbitrary Programs</h3>

<p>
Emulators are not the only program that Game Launcher can run.  Any
arbitrary program can be launched.  I've included one technique to do
this with the "Misc" menu.  The "Misc" menu scans the <tt>/misc/</tt>
directory for any batch files.  These batch files are added to the
menu and run when launched.  You can create batch files to launch any
command line program.  I have used this to run Doom, Quake, and the
QuickView video program.  Please see the <tt>misc.cfg</tt> and
<tt>misc.map</tt> files for more information.
</p>

<h2>Running Game Launcher</h2>

<p>
After configuring Game Launcher, type "glaunch" to run it.  There are
no command line options.  If the configuration is setup correctly, you
will get a list of games to choose from.  You may move up or down one
game at a time or one page at a time.  You may also switch emulators
in which case a new selection of games will be presented.  A small
icon will appear to the right of the names of games that have a screen
shot available.  The icon may be turned off in the global
configuration file.
</p>

<h3> Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>
There are a number of avenues to pursue if you have problems getting
Game Launcher to do what you want.  The first thing you should do is
turn on debug mode by changing the <tt>debug</tt> parameter in
<tt>glaunch.cfg</tt>.  This allows you to see exactly what commands
are being run and the output of the commands.  It is invaluable to
help you narrow down configuration issues.
</p>

<p>
A number of log files are also generated in the <tt>log/</tt>
directory.  The <tt>glaunch.log</tt> file contains various information
and error messages.  You may sometimes find helpful information in
here when things go wrong.  The <tt>runit.log</tt> file contains the
output of the last emulator launched.  If an emulator does not run as
expected, an error message may be available in this file.  Both of
these log files are rotated so that the 6 newest copies are kept
around.
</p>

<p>
If you still are having problems, join the glaunch-public mailing list
and ask questions there.  Always provide as much information as
possible when soliciting help, such as which version of Game Launcher
you are using, which operating system you are using, and anything else
that may be pertinent (sound cards, video cards, etc.).  Attaching the
<tt>glaunch.log</tt> file can also provide good background information
to people willing to help.  For information on how to subscribe to the
mailing list, please see the <a
href="http://www.dribin.org/dave/game_launcher/">Game Launcher web
site</a>.
</p>

<h3>The State File</h3>

<p>
The file <tt>glaunch.sta</tt> contains state information that needs to
be preserved between invocations.  Do not edit this file as the data
is internal to Game Launcher.  You may safely delete this file without
affecting any of your configuration files.
